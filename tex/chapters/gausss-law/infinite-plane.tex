\section{Infinite plane}
An infinite plane with charge density per unit of area $\sigma$ in empty space, located on the x-y plane is given. Due to the symmetry of a
system, the electric field is constant and in the direction of the $z$-axis.


\be\label{infinite-plane-e-field}
\mathbf{E} = E_{z}(z) \cdot \uvec{z} = E_z \cdot \frac{z}{|z|}\uvec{z}
\ee

By replacing \ref{infinite-plane-e-field} in \ref{gauss-law}, we can write
\be\label{infinite-plane-flux}
\oiint_A E_{z}(z) \cdot \uvec{z} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A} =\frac{Q_{encl}}{\epsilon_0}
\ee
where $\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A} = \mathrm{d}x \mathrm{d}y$ is infinitesimal area with the direction normal to the surface and parallel to the
$z$-axis.

Considering a parallelepiped centered at the location of the charged plane, the only contributions to the flux are those that are parallel
to $z$-axis,

\be\label{}
\oiint_A E_z \cdot \frac{z}{|z|}\uvec{z} \cdot \mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y\uvec{z} + \oiint_A E_z \cdot \frac{-z}{|z|}\uvec{z} \cdot \mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y\uvec{z} = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}
\ee
from which
\be
\mathbf{E}=\frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{z}{|z|} \uvec{r}
\ee
