\section{Introduction}
Given an electric field $\vec{E}(\vec{r})$ and a closed surface $A$, according to Gauss's law
\be\label{gauss-law}
\Phi_E = \oiint_A \vec{E} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{A} =\frac{Q_{encl}}{\epsilon_0}
\ee
where $Q_{encl}$ is the total charge enclosed in $A$, $\mathrm{d}\vec{A}=\mathrm{d}A\uvec{n}$ is an infinitesimal area $\mathrm{d}A$ with
direction $\uvec{n}$, the latter defined as the outward-pointing normal of the surface at the point under consideration.
